  intro:
    topic: storms
    jillian: We’ve been getting a lot of thunderstorms here lately. I’m not
      one to check my weather app every day, so I love getting surprised by
      thunder and rain clouds. It feels special when I can text my boyfriend
      (who lives in the same neighborhood as me) about the storm I know we’re
      both experiencing. It feels special when I check Twitter and see a bunch
      of people in New York posting about the same rain, the same lightning.
      This is true of all weather, of course—everyone in my city experiences the
      same sunshine and the same wind and the same fog. But storms are a special
      occasion, even when they happen several times a week.
    summer: I woke up around 3am this morning and there was a little
      earthquake! It was really minor but just a little spooky. It doesn’t storm
      too often in California, but whenever there’s an earthquake I think about
      living in Michigan and tornadoes. When there was a tornado warning, my
      family would sit in a room in the basement where all of my toys were
      because it was the only room in the house with no windows. It was eerie,
      to be in a room that was technically fun because…it had my toys! but also
      scary, because of the circumstance and the fact that you couldn’t really
      know what was happening outside. If there was a tornado warning while I
      was at school, we’d all huddle in between shelves in the library; a
      similar feeling here—surrounded by books, but unable to engage, just
      curled up in a ball listening intently to the wind. There’s a grotesque
      nostalgia attached to storm-sounds for me; scary! potentially destructive!
      but I was a kid? and things were easier? there were less things to be
      afraid of. And that’s comforting, somehow.

    title01: Witch Hat Atelier
    desc01: My friend Helen had been talking about [this
      manga](https://kodansha.us/series/witch-hat-atelier/) for a while and I
      had seen it recommended elsewhere as a sort of reparative-Harry Potter,
      lol. I finally started reading it a few weeks ago and I love it!!!! I’m on
      Volume 7, but so so so excited to get through the rest and also
      anticipating the anime soon. It is so sweet and the way it handles
      education is so HEART-WARMING? I feel like if society took on the
      pedagogical practices of Qifrey we would live in a better world? Which
      feels silly to say, but I’m having a blast. I checked out my copies from
      the library, but there are sure to be porn-ad riddled scanlation sites out
      there.

    title02: Dance Fever
    desc02: New Florence + The Machine album!!!!!! I’ve had this on repeat
      since it dropped. I love it SO much, the vibe is absolutely perfect for a
      “I’m kinda insane but let’s have fun with it”-streak which I am currently
      on. I think “Free” is my favorite song so far and also “Girls Against
      God.” The titles of the songs are also SO fucking good. [Listen on
      Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ohh1zQ4yybSK9FS7LLyDE) or
      wherever you listen to music!

    title01: Video game ambience
    desc01: "I know I’ve mentioned that I like to listen to lofi video game
      music while I work. But video game ambiance is a different thing
      entirely—think coffee shop vibes, but in your favorite video game. There
      are so many ambiance videos on Youtube: you could spend hours feeling like
      you’re [exploring Central
      Hyrule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CID4g0u1TOI), wandering
      around [Garreg
      Mach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5yLp81aU5k&t=10161s), or [taking a
      coffee break at the Roost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dlCY7XNIfQ).
      Some of my favorite channels for video game ambience are [Luna
      Ambience](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3jN6scZ5RiG6Sv0k2Mb94w/videos\
      ) and [Gamescapes](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamescapes), but you can
      search for whatever game you want to hang out in."

    title02: Stranger Things
    desc02: Every time a new season of [Stranger
      Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281) comes out, I resist for a
      few days, thinking surely I won’t enjoy it as much as I remember. And I’m
      always wrong! I want to be cool, I want to be critical, I want to be a
      hater (why? I don’t know). But the thing is that it is just such a fun
      show to watch. I love all the characters, I genuinely enjoy watching them
      grow, and I always have a hard time stopping myself from watching *just
      one more episode* once I get started. I had a great time watching this
      latest season—and I can’t wait for the next episodes.
